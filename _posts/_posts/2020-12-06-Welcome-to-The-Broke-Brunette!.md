title: Welcome to The Broke Brunette!

Hello! Howdy! Welcome!

I am Brooke Johnson, or otherwise known at The Broke Brunette. No one actually calls me that, so you can just call me Brooke.

I am a college senior (soon to be college graduate!) at THE Texas A&M University, the best university in the world! WHOOP! I am engaged to the love of my life, moving to a new city soon, and finally figuring out what it means to be an adult.

The Broke Brunette stemmed from a desire within myself to learn about my own finances. I quickly realized this was a passion of mine, combined with my love for helping people and teaching.

I realize that I am young. I am only 22 years old! I am not writing because I know everything about personal finance and somehow I have the secret to not impulse buy home d√©cor at Target. I am writing because I enjoy it and want to learn more. I hope you will learn something new as well!

Without further ado,

Welcome to The Broke Brunette blog!!
