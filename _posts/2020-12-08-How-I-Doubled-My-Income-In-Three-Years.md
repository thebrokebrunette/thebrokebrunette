title: How I Doubled My Income In Three Years
---

*Before reading this post, please read “My Privilege Statement".*

I started working when I was 20 years old, the summer before my junior year in college. I had worked multiple jobs in high school and early college, but I did not stick to one job for long until this particular summer. During this summer, I worked three different jobs. I worked as a housekeeper for an elderly lady in my college town, as a cashier at Freddy’s Frozen Custard, and as a Sunday school teacher at my church. As the summer ended and my fall classes started, I quit my job as a housekeeper but kept my other two jobs.

I worked about 15 hour a week. Although this did not allow for a hefty paycheck, it was what I could manage while balancing a full course load in school.
	Salary: 8.00/hour – Cashier at Freddy’s Frozen Custard
  10.00/hour – Sunday school teacher at my church

After working at Freddy’s for a year and some change, I was convinced by my coworker to join her in working at a local retirement community. I was hired on as a server and I could not believe I was getting paid more! I was paid hourly because this was a retirement community, and the company did not allow the residents to pay the servers tips in any way. To compensate for this, the company offered a competitive pay for the position. This was the most money I had ever made in my life!
	Salary: 11.00/hour – Server at retirement community

At the end of April 2020, I was asked to help out with the Activities department. The timing was perfect, for me at least, because two Coordinators left this department a few weeks before the COVID-19 restrictions began. Because of this, the Activities department was unable to hire outside of the company and had to look within. Cue me being asked by my supervisor to leave my bowtie and nonslip shoes behind for business casual.

This was a large step in

This was the first time in a while that I had felt excited about working. I felt like I was moving into a position where I was able to show my strengths in a more professional setting.
	Salary: 14.50/hour – Wellness & Engagement Coordinator at retirement community

In November 2020, I accepted a job post-graduation.
  Salary: 21.15/hour

Here is how I did it:

1. I took risks.

2. I made a thoughtful impact in my supervision’s eyes. Without my supervisor knowing my work ethic and empathy for the residents, I would not have been chosen to assist with the activities department. I did the basic things all employees strive to do: show up on time, lend a hand to others, be professional, try your best, and care for the residents/customers/clients.

3. I made my skills and talents known. When I was promoted to the position of a Wellness & Engagement Coordinator, I quickly tried to make an impact in the department. This was through my advanced technology and critical thinking skills. I was able to work quicker than the rest of the department when creating flyers, handouts, activity planners, and monthly calendars. This was the motivating factor behind my permanent transition into this role.

4. I was confident and advocated for myself. When I transitioned into a new department, I was unsure if my new supervisor was planning on hiring me on permanently. I advocated for myself by letting my supervisor know that I would love to stay within the department and asking questions as to how I would be able to achieve that.

5. I graduated from college. This is the most important aspect to highlight here because this was the additional factor that secured me my current position. I understand that this opportunity places me in a position that is not available to everyone, but I would strongly encourage everyone to, at a minimum, consider their options for furthering their education in some way.
