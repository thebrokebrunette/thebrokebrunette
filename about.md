Welcome to my blog! This is my space to discuss all things personal finance!

My name is Brooke Johnson. I am a Texas A&M Former Student (Class of 2020 â€“ WHOOP!), a (soon-to-be) wife, and a strong believer that everyone should be in control of their money, especially women.

I started The Broke Brunette when I wanted to learn more about finance during my junior year of college. I wanted a space to discuss the topics I love to learn about, like budgeting and investing. I write about topics that I have already learned about such as high school jobs and how to pay for college, as well as topics I do not know enough about like how much should I save every month. I write to spread what I have learned in hopes that it will help someone else, but also to learn more about my own finances.

In addition to the blog, The Broke Brunette also is a podcast and a YouTube channel!
